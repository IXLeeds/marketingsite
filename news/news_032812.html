<b>LINX donates switching gear to IXLeeds to kickstart UK regional peering programme.
</b>
<br/>
<p>Release date: Tuesday 27 March 2012
</p>
<p>
The London Internet Exchange (LINX), one of the world's largest Internet Exchange Points (IXP), has donated a Brocade RX-8 switch to IXLeeds as part of it's mission to support regional peering in the UK.
</p>
<p>
IXLeeds was created to allow Internet Service Providers in the region to increase their network resilience and reduce dependency on similar platforms in London.
</p>
<p>
Andy Davidson, IXLeeds Board Chair, said upon receiving the equipment, "We are extremely grateful to LINX for this very generous gesture. The RX-8 is a capable platform and enables us to increase our previous maximum capacity by a factor of 10. This will allow us to comfortably handle future requirements such as the expected increase in traffic with the sporting calendar during 2012.”
</p>
<p>
He continued, "The switch has been installed and is already operational. IXLeeds' traffic has been migrated across to the new equipment and users in the region are already benefiting from increased Internet capacity."
</p>
<p>
LINX CEO, John Souter, personally presented the Brocade RX-8 equipment at the most recent IXLeeds board meeting.
</p>
<p>
Mr Souter commented, "This industry has a long history of collaboration and in doing so we are all helping each other build a stronger and more resilient Internet. We are very supportive of any mutual IXP that facilitates peering as this has been proven to be the most successful model for the Internet industry. If we are able assist such ventures then it makes perfect sense that we do all we can to help."
